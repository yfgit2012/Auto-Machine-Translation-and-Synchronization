# Auto Machine Translation and Synchronization

To efficiently handle these multiple languages, we have developed the Auto Machine Translation and Synchronization (AMTS) system using Amazon Translate, which aims to reduce the workload of human translators by 80%. The AMTS can be applied to all the languages for translation, and each language-specific sub-AMTS pipeline has its own unique features based on language characteristics and translator preferences.
